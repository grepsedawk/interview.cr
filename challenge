A Holiday gift exchange is where a group of people are randomly assigned one other person in the group to buy a gift for. This person can be anyone else in the group except for themselves. Everyone should both give and receive a gift.

Design a program that reads a provided CSV file, performs the matching, and then prints out the matches. Assume that you may email the match to the person later, but focus on printing first.

The format of the CSV is name,email on each row.

Don't actually send email for this example. Assume the system or framework has a mail delivery system available.
